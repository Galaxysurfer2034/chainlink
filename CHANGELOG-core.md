## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Solidity: Renamed the previous `AggregatorInterface.sol` to
`HistoricAggregatorInterface.sol`. Users are encouraged to use the new methods
introduced on the `AggregatorInterface`(`getRoundData` and `latestRoundData`),
as they return metadata to indicate freshness of the data in a single
cross-contract call.

## [0.8.4] - 2020-05-18

### Added

- Fluxmonitor initiators may now optionally include an `absoluteThreshold`
parameter. To trigger a new on-chain report, the absolute difference in the feed
value must change by at least the `absoluteThreshold` value. If it is
unspecified or zero, fluxmonitor behavior is unchanged.
- Database Migrations: Add created_at and updated_at to all tables allowing for
better historical insights. This migration may take a minute or two on large
databases.

### Fixed

- Fix incorrect permissions on some files written by the node
Prevent a case where duplicate ethereum keys could be added
Improve robustness and reliability of ethtx transaction logic

## [0.8.3] - 2020-05-04

### Added

- Added Changelog.
- Database Migrations: There a number of database migrations included in this
release as part of our ongoing effort to make the node even more reliable and
stable, and build a firm foundation for future development.

### Changed

- New cron strings MUST now include time zone. If you want your jobs to run in
UTC for example: `CRON_TZ=UTC * * * * *`. Previously, jobs specified without a
time zone would run in the server's native time zone, which in most cases is UTC
but this was never guaranteed.

### Fixed

- Fix crash in experimental gas updater when run on Kovan network
