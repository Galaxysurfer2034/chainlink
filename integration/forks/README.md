# Integration test for ommers and re-orgs

## Docker images

From `integration/forks/bootnode`

```
docker build . -t bootnode:latest
```

From `integration/forks`
```
docker build . -t geth:latest
```

## Invoking this framework

Run `docker-compose --compatibility up`.

To trigger a block-reorg on `chainlink`/`geth1`, disconnect `geth2` from the network with

```
docker network disconnect forks_gethnet forks_geth2_1
```

Here `forks_gethnet` is the appropriate network name as reported by `docker network  ls | grep gethnet | awk '{ print $2 }'`, and `forks_geth2_1` is the appropriate container name as reported by `docker ps -a | grep geth2 | awk '{ print $(NF) }'`. These names may change depending on `docker-compose` and the directory in which you run this test.

Once `geth1`'s logs indicate that it's mined a few solo blocks, reconnect with `docker network connect <network name> <container name>`. You should see output like this in the logs:

The `block lost` entries indicate that the blocks `geth1` solo-mined have been discarded in favor of `geth2`'s longer/heavier chain.


## Construction of this initial blockchain state

To reproduce a rough facsimile of the artifacts in this directory, follow these steps. Be careful: `geth` is not very user-friendly, and, given inconsistent inputs, will behave in unintuitive, cryptic, and disappointing ways.

1. Copy and modify `geth-config-1.toml`. The original came from the output of `geth dumpconfig`.
2. Run `initialize-node-data.sh <n>` for `<n>` ranging over the `<n>`s in the `geth-config-<n>.toml`s. That script has more details about what it does.
3. Put all the enode addresses output by `initialize-node-data.sh` in all the *other* `geth-config-<n>.toml`'s `StaticNodes` lists. E.g., if `initialize-node-data.sh 2` outputs `enode://addr@ipaddr:port`, the `StaticNodes` list in `geth-config-1.toml` should contain `"enode://addr@ipaddr:port"`. Note that `ipaddr` will need to change, based on the IP address you assign to `geth2` in the next step.
4. Make stanzas corresponding to each `geth-config-<n>.toml` in `docker-compose.yaml`, like
   ```
     geth1:
       image: ethereum/client-go
       restart: on-failure
       command:
         --mine
         --miner.threads 1
         --config /root/geth-config-1.toml
         --unlock "0x9ca9d2d5e04012c9ed24c0e513c9bfaa4a2dd77f"
         --password /run/secrets/node_password
         --nat extip:172.16.1.100
       volumes:
         - .:/root
       networks:
         gethnet:
           ipv4_address: 172.16.1.100
       ports: []
       secrets:
         - node_password
   ```
   (But this is just an example. Crib from the stanza in `docker-compose.yaml`, because that'll break noisily if it goes out of date.)

   Note that it's essential for `--miner.threads` to be positive. The default value is `0`, and if you leave it at that, `geth` will indicate that it's started mining with `Commit new mining work`, but will not actually mine.

   You don't need the account information (`--unlock`, `--password`) on instances which chainlink won't connect to.

5. Adjust the IP addresses in the `geth-config-<n>.toml`s to match those in the corresponding `docker-compose.yaml` stanzas. That includes the IP addresses in the enode addresses.
6. Run `docker-compose up geth1 ... geth<n>`. Check the containers' outputs to verify that they are sharing blocks. For instance, you should see matching hashes between containers, like this:
   ```

   geth1_1      | INFO [06-13|07:27:59.247] ðŸ”— block reached canonical chain          number=8  hash=a922c6â€¦b0a076
       ^                                                                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   ```
   This means that container `geth1_1`'s block with hash a922c6â€¦b0a076 was imported and accepted by container `geth2_1**.

## Constructing the trigger transaction

The goal of this framework is to test how chainlink responds to logs from the
ethereum blockchain in the context of a re-org. Therefore, we need to construct
a transaction which emits a log. Here is how I did this. You may want to
automate this, if you're adjusting your solidity contract a lot.

1. Get the binary for `Trigger.sol` with `solc --bin contracts/Trigger.sol`.
2. Place that binary output in the assignment to `contract_data` in
   `generate_tx.rb`.
3. `sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev ruby-bundler`
4. Build `digest-sha3-ruby` with `CFLAGS+-Wno-format-security`. (Straight `gem
   install eth` fails for me, [as described
   here](https://github.com/phusion/digest-sha3-ruby/issues/7).)

   `git clone https://github.com/izetex/digest-sha3-ruby`

   `cd digest-sha3-ruby; gem build digest-sha3.gemspec`

   `sudo gem install digest-sha3-1.1.0.gem`
5. `sudo gem install eth`
6. Test the script by running `ruby generate_tx.rb`. The output from this is
   assigned to `${TRANSACTION_HEX}` in `Makefile`.
